      <p class="adviceParagraph">
        Give yourself an edge with these 25 gems of sage advice that most people
        ignore.
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Take time to know yourself. "Know thyself" said Aristotle. When you
        know who you are, you can be wise about your goals, your dreams, your
        standards, your convictions. Knowing who you are allows you to live your
        life with purpose and meaning.
        <br />
        2. A narrow focus brings big results. The number one reason people give
        up so fast is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go
        instead of how far they have come. But it's a series of small wins that
        can give us the most significant success.
        <br />
        3. Show up fully. Don't dwell on the past, and don't daydream about the
        future, but concentrate on showing up fully in the present moment.
        <br />
        4. Don't make assumptions. If you don't know the situation fully, you
        can't offer an informed opinion.
        <br />
        5. Be patient and persistent. Life is not so much what you accomplish as
        what you overcome.
        <br />
        6. In order to get, you have to give. If you support, guide, and lead
        others, if you make contributions to their lives, you will reap the best
        rewards.
        <br />
        7. Luck comes from hard work. Luck happens when hard work and timing and
        talent intersect.
        <br />
        8. Be your best at all times. You never know what the future will bring,
        so always make the best use of the present.
        <br />
        9. Don't try to impress everyone. The unhappiest people are those who
        care the most about what other people think.
        <br />
        10. Don't be afraid of being afraid. Sometimes the one thing you need
        for growth is the one thing you are most afraid to do.
        <br />
        11. Listen to learn. Learn how to listen. You can't learn anything when
        you're talking.
        <br />
        12. Life's good, but it's not fair. The delusion that life's supposed to
        be fair is the source of much unhappiness.
        <br />
        13. No task is beneath you. Don't put yourself above anyone or anything;
        work hard in silence and let success make the noise.
        <br />
        14. You can't always get what you want. But, as the song says, if you
        try you may find you get what you need.
        <br />
        15. Don't make decisions when you are angry or ecstatic. The best
        decisions are made with a clear conscious mind, not in the throes of any
        emotion--positive or negative.
        <br />
        16. Don't worry what other people think. Personality begins where
        comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud.
        <br />
        17. Use adversity as an opportunity. Every loss leads to an opportunity,
        and every adversity leads to new possibilities.
        <br />
        18. Do what is right, not what is easy. Strength of character leads us
        to do the right thing, even when there are easier options.
        <br />
        19. Dreams remain dreams until you take action. Without action, an idea
        is just a dream.
        <br />
        20. Treat others the way you want to be treated. Do right. Do your best.
        Treat others as you would want them to treat you.
        <br />
        21. When you quit, you fail. The surest way to lose at any endeavor is
        to quit. But fatigue, discomfort, and discouragement are merely symptoms
        of effort.
        <br />
        22. Trust your instincts. What good is intuition if you let
        second-guessing drown it out? The worst enemy of success is self-doubt.
        <br />
        23. Learn something new every day. Have the mindset of a student. Never
        think you are too old to ask questions or know too much to learn
        something new.
        <br />
        24. Make what is valuable important. Instead of thinking about what is
        profitable, think about what is valuable. Invest in others and you will
        grow your portfolio.
        <br />
        25. Believe in yourself. The way you see yourself is the way you will
        treat yourself, and the way you treat yourself is what you become.
        <br />
        Sometimes we get excellent advice but we forget to take it in. Take it
        in and pass it on.
